How it Works
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Background Remover component works:

The component renders an interface with a file input field.

When an image file is selected using the file input, the handleImageUpload function is triggered.

The selected image file is prepared for upload by creating a FormData object and appending the file to it.

A POST request is sent to the Remove.bg API endpoint using fetch. The API key is included in the request headers.

If the API call is successful (response.ok), the response is processed.

The background-removed image URL is extracted from the response and set in the component's state using setRemovedImageUrl.

The original image URL and the background-removed image URL are displayed side by side in the component.

If an error occurs during the API call or if the response is not successful, an error message is logged to the console.
